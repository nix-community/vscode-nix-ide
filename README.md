* Full editing support with [rnix-LSP](https://github.com/nix-community/rnix-lsp)

* When `Language Server` support is not enabled the following tools are used to
  + Formatting support. Set `nix.formatterPath` to any command which can accept file contents on stdin and return formatted text on stdout; e.g.,
      ```json
      {
        "nix.formatterPath": "nixpkgs-fmt" // default
        // "nix.formatterPath": "nixfmt" 
        // "nix.formatterPath": ["treefmt", "--stdin", "{file}"]
        // "nix.formatterPath": ["nix", "fmt", "--", "-"] // using flakes with `formatter = pkgs.alejandra;`
      }
      ```
  + Error Report
    - Using `nix-instantiate` errors reported
